**HOW TO WRITE A GIT COMMENT**

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line -Sometimes a comment might require more detailed         explanation.

2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters- This will insure your comment is readable, cap character count at 72.

3. Capitalize the subject line- Easy. Just do it.

4. Do not end the subject line with a period. Trailing punctuation is unnecessary and space is precious.

5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line- Meaning, write as if giving a command or instruction.

6. Wrap the body at 72 characters.

7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how -If your code is complex it needs to be explained to future committers/maintainers, if you donâ€™t take the time to explain it now it will be lost forever.
